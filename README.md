Linked Lists and Hash Tables in C

This project stores customer data as linked list nodes, within a hash table whose keys are head pointers to the linked lists.

To run this project:

1) clone repo into a local directory and cwd into it

2) run "make all" at the command line to build the application\n

3) assuming everything compiles properly:

    a) Run ./static_hash_map to use the statically allocated hash map (less flexible)
    
    b) Run ./dynamic_hash_map to use the a dynamically allocated hash map (more flexible)
